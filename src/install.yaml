  generation_prompt: >
    The resulting json object must contain an items array nested within a second items array within the qset->data object. The data object should
    additionally contain an options key with two properties: freeWords and hintPenalty. The default values for these two properties are 1 and 50 respectively. The
    hint value present in each question's options object should provide slightly more information or context to help students guess the associated word, and be more
    substantive than simply offering the first letter.
